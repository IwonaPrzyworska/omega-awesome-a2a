## Addition of SALMA Framework

Added SALMA (Self-Adaptive Language Model Agents) to the repository's multimodal AI systems section.

### Resource Details
- Paper: [SALMA: Self-Adaptive Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00290)
- Code: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/SALMA)

### Analysis
SALMA represents a breakthrough in autonomous AI agent development by introducing a framework where agents can dynamically adapt their behavior through self-reflection and learning from interactions. The framework demonstrates quantifiable improvements in task performance and generalization without human intervention, making it particularly valuable for multimodal AI applications.

### Technical Implementation
Key components:
```python
# Core adaptation loop
def adapt_behavior(self):
    reflection = self.reflect_on_past_interactions()
    new_strategy = self.update_strategy(reflection)
    return self.implement_strategy(new_strategy)
# Example implementation of SALMA's core adaptation loop
class SALMAAgent:
    def __init__(self, reflection_buffer_size=1000):
        self.reflection_buffer = []
        self.buffer_size = reflection_buffer_size
    
    def adapt(self, experience):
        # Phase 1: Experience Collection
        self.reflection_buffer.append(experience)
        
        # Phase 2: Reflection
        insights = self.reflect_on_experiences()
        
        # Phase 3: Behavioral Adaptation
        self.update_behavior(insights)
