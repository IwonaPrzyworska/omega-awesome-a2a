## Text-Guided 3D Scene Editing

### GaussianEditor: Fast & Precise 3D Scene Editing via Gaussian Splatting

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.XXXXX) | [Project Page](https://GaussianEditor.github.io) | [Code](https://github.com/GaussianEditor/GaussianEditor)

GaussianEditor represents a significant advancement in 3D scene editing by leveraging explicit 3D Gaussian representations for precise, localized modifications. Unlike traditional diffusion-based approaches, it enables targeted editing of specific scene regions while maintaining global consistency.

Key Implementation Details:
```python
# Core RoI extraction and Gaussian alignment
def extract_gaussian_roi(text_prompt, scene_gaussians):
    # Extract region of interest from text
    roi_bounds = text_to_spatial_bounds(text_prompt)
    
    # Align with 3D Gaussians
    relevant_gaussians = filter_gaussians_in_bounds(
        scene_gaussians, 
        roi_bounds,
        threshold=0.85  # Confidence threshold
    )
    return relevant_gaussians

# Fast editing pipeline
class GaussianEditor:
    def edit_scene(self, gaussians, text_prompt):
        roi = extract_gaussian_roi(text_prompt, gaussians)
        edited_gaussians = apply_editing_transform(
            roi,
            editing_strength=0.7,
            preserve_structure=True
        )
        return merge_with_scene(gaussians, edited_gaussians)
