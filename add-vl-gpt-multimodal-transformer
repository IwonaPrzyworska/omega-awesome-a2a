### VL-GPT: Vision-Language Generative Pre-trained Transformer

**Paper Link**: [arXiv:2312.09251](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09251)

**Category**: Multimodal Foundation Models

**Key Innovation**: VL-GPT introduces a groundbreaking unified approach for processing both visual and linguistic data through a single transformer architecture. The key technical advancement is its novel image tokenizer-detokenizer framework that converts images into continuous embeddings, enabling true multimodal sequence processing with a unified auto-regressive objective.

**Technical Details**:
- Architecture: Unified transformer with image tokenizer-detokenizer framework
- Training Objective: Single auto-regressive next-token prediction for both modalities
- Capabilities: 
  - Zero-shot and few-shot performance across multiple tasks
  - In-context learning with multimodal prompts
  - Image captioning, VQA, text-to-image generation

**Implementation Example**:
```python
from vl_gpt import VLGPT, ImageTokenizer

# Initialize model and tokenizer
model = VLGPT.from_pretrained('vl-gpt-base')
image_tokenizer = ImageTokenizer()

# Process multimodal input
image = load_image('example.jpg')
text = "Describe this image:"

# Convert image to tokens
image_tokens = image_tokenizer.encode(image)

# Generate response
output = model.generate(
    image_tokens + text_tokens,
    max_length=100,
    temperature=0.7
)
